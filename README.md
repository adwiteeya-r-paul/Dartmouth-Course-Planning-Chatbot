# Dartmouth-Course-Planning-Chatbot

Planning 4 years of college? Always stressful. But it is in many ways even more stressful for Dartmouth students, because of:

1. `"D-Plan" system` -  12 ON terms and 3 OFF terms
2. `Course availabilities` - doesnt always align with ON term
3. `3 study abroad opportunities` - priority for many people
4. `13 distributives in 12 terms` - with prerequisites, majors, minors and culminating experiences
5. `2 midterms, 1 final and many weekly assignments in 10 weeks` - for each course; cramming extra courses in one term not feasible

# Motivation behind project:

Some lived and shared experiences that drives my interest for this project : 

1. my current struggle planning for 1 major + 2 minors + 3 study abroads
2. friends with non-traditional D-Plan (due to disability/medical reasons) needing better planning system.
3. friends graduating late because of missing distributives losing financial aid eligibility
4. friends in interdisciplinary majors having to have 7-8 department websites open to plan their schedule.

# Current features of Chatbot:

1. Parses course, prerequisite, distributives and terms offered for COSC, COGS, LING, PHIL AND PSYC departments
2. Stores these information in databases
3. Can present this informatuion in user-friendly tables
4. Ensures prerequisites to be done before suggesting any course
5. Takes writing requirement into account

With these features, the Chatbot can currently provide one-year-plan for the "Cognitive Science" major with the writing requirement done, an interdisclinary major that requires COSC, COGS, LING, PHIL and PSYC classes.

# Ongoing improvements:

1. Currently working on user-input-parsing
2. Extending to 4 years
3. Ensuring all requirements

# Future improvements:

1. Extending to all majors
2. Deployment
3. User testing
